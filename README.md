You are given a random dollar amount and need to find out what the minimum number of coins needed to make that amount. The answer should be in a hash where the key is the coin type and the value is the number of coins needed. If given ``2.48``, then the answer would be ``{Quarters: 9, Dimes: 2, Nickels: 0, Pennies: 3}``.
